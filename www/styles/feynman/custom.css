/* OPTION DETAILS

__Dashboard Highlights__
This is a little CSS script that super-sizes the top 3 items for each category. You can use this to highlight 
some of your devices, or give their buttons a little more breathing room. This only works for the normal view, 
because the compact view is about saving space.

__Navigation main sidemenu__
This moves the main menu to the left side of the screen. It works best for wide screens (about 980 pixels wide 
is my recommendation).

__Settings Sidemenu__
Instead of the tabs at the top of each settings page, you get a sidebar instead. It stays in place. This 
includes the 'save' button, so you always have easy access to that.

__Extra's and animations__
Adds some pretty details (checkboxes) and animations (dialog pop-ups).
